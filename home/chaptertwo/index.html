  I woke up at about seven o'clock. I went to the kitchen for food. On the way to the kitchen, I thought about how to escape from the complex. Item one: find out the building of the complex. Point the second: to know in what country am. Point three: Learn the habits of the guards. Point four: see who can help. Point five: find shelter. I got food and started eating it. It was plain at a meal. There were no pebbles in it. From the dining room again three figures took away, when-but I'll get used to it. Walking through the free territory I saw jelly which either crawls, or walks. At first, I truthful, first time in life such see, jelly on legs. Noticing me gelatine being crawled or went. It doesn't matter if he walks or crawls. It's coming to me. All the prisoners are laughing at me. I'm not laughing. It's at my feet. Then it came to me... And began to lick. if I may say so. Then it leaped down and ran gleefully about its business. Suddenly a convict came up to me and said: <br/>
"It's jelly, and he likes you."<br/>
I wiped my face with my hand and went about my business. Many carried boxes and gave them to the cook. On that they gave money. Then I sat in a chair and considered my escape plan. It all came down to me dying or chaos.<br/>
- Time 12: 00.  A voice announced.<br/>
 Well, first you need to find a sheet of paper and a pencil. Logically, I will get this huckster. So we need money. And who can give work? That's right, the chef. Go to him. On the way to the cook's, I met jelly. I'm almost used to it. But he was still nervous. I'm going to run." Almost have cooks she has lagged.<br/>
"What do you want?"  the cook asked<br/>
"I need a job,"  I said.<br/>
"I have a couple of assignments." Did you see the door with the combination lock? So here is need to there penetrate, and find a box with the banner " Not run." I recommend not to do this. Kill you. Password 0290. There rarely who goes and cameras there is no. You bring it, you get 25 bucks SCP. It's the local currency. I must say, you can't buy much with it. Good luck.<br/>
"Okay, okay.<br/>
I went to the door. Enter the password. I had a view of the warehouse. There were a lot of iron shelves with boxes.  Something told me that it was wrong to look at the contents, and just pick up what I came for. Do so. Korotka was in a prominent place. With mind she the easy and small. But in practice, it is heavy and average. I dragged her to him. The money was very pleasant to the touch. When I came out of the dining room a huckster came up to me and started a dialogue:<br/>
"I see you're not just going to sit on your ass and wait for a miracle." I respect guys like that. Skip you.<br/>
- 22 years old.<br/>
- Young, and already forever. Why do you sit? Although, it doesn't matter. You'll be here for a long time. Here you can make money differently. Buy materials from merchants and do things at night. Why do inappropriately during the day? So as all don't care about them that you one takes, but Okhrana can divert to SCP or take from all, and at night they don't care on all. For your twenty-five bucks, I can give you two sheets of paper and a pack of tobacco.  the merchant said and held out his hand. He was right. you don't make much money carrying boxes and crates.  I handed him money, and he 2 leaf and tobacco. Then he continued: you Tear the sheet in half, then you sprinkle tobacco all over the area and twist it, then you moisten the paper with saliva and glue it with such a plaster, and one end you apply, it will be instead of a filter. Good luck. "what's the matter?" asked the peddler, and went about his business.<br/>
The cook is a big shot here, so we need to work for him from time to time. He has more connections than I do. Okay, better materials attributed to him in the camera, and then suddenly covet my stuff. I put them in the nightstand. It was 13: 30. Lunch is coming. Returning to the resting area and saw a man. He was big, and he kept walking around with dumbbells. The scientists who accompanied him kept their distance. All -??? I learned for whom much barbell. As I watched him move the voice began to speak again:<br/>
- Time 14: 00. He would be back in his cell in twenty minutes. You see someone in quiet hours will be sent to be devoured by SCP is a cannibal. - a voice said and I blacked out. So that's something. 22: 00 night begins, 14: 20 * quiet hour*. The cook had soup, he did not praise it, because all the food is good. After the meal was over, I went to my cell.<br/>
 I wanted to start doing things now, but something told me not to. I lay down and mentally tried to imagine the location. All to no purpose, for trying to start a fight you can give food...<br/>
"So what are you doing here?" Hehe. It seems we have a holiday today. Eight whitefish and a lighter. - probably the guard burned that someone makes Sigi. Further, there were blows. Yeah, she's kind. I wonder if there will be a round-up at night? The time was 16: 00...<br/>
- You can leave the cells.  a voice rang out, and there was a hum of door spikes.<br/>
 The checkpoint post introduced into the unknown was empty or wanted to appear empty. A moment later, a guard came out of the checkpoint door. His steps were heavy and uncertain. So they were asleep. The first weak point of the checkpoint is found. The night I will not sit to do the sigs, and wait for the bypass. I am prebiotics a ball with eyes, a red zeta. He took the form of an animal and showed that he wants to meet. Then we played a little and he became a ball back. The rest of the time he dozed. I'm going to have a fun night. About six o'clock I ate and returned to my cell. In the hope that voice will Wake up in 22:00.<br/>
 In a dream I appeared in nowhere. just a white platform and white surroundings. And out of nowhere, a man appeared. In a business suit and a top hat. His eyes were full of interest. And here's the weird thing: brains work. I not on 5-10% control action in dream, and 100%. Almost control sleep while the body sleeps.<br/>
- Welcome to the complex! Usually, at this moment newcomers, I'm abandoning. BUT, you got my attention. On the second day of your stay, you're ready to run. Well, in any case, the plan was.  So I'll be watching you. I'll tell you one thing, don't blink for as long as you can.  Good luck! "he returned to the yellow triangle and disappeared. I woke up. It was ten o'clock and the voice was finishing the announcement. I was full of energy.<br/>
 It was necessary to act in court. I lay and pretended to sleep. The clock was a projection and at night it glowed. So the time was right. During my stay here, I grew little nails, and could they vytsaramat time when the guard appears on the floor, comes to the row with my camera and comes to me. Time 00: 00. There was a grinding of the door which is at the checkpoint. I bit off part of my toenail. He scrawled numbers lightly with the pointed end. An hour later, the door opened. It was short-lived. I looked at my watch and made a note: 1:00. And then my door opened. They went all the way around the cell, looked inside, and left. Recorded: 1: 00. Then you can sleep. In the morning on the bedside table, I saw a piece of a photograph and the inscription: SCP-173.<br/>
