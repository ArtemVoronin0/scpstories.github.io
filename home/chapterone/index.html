   The cell habitually has been closed. For the fourth year now I have been dreaming of freedom, but those who go to jail do not see it. Those who run away usually fall back or die. The only fear of all prisoners is to fall into the unknown. Now I'm not talking about death or something like that. I'm about what someone buys them, and they disappear forever. On TV they show their ads: "You have no money? You are without education? You are doing something well, but you do not have the necessary documents? Then you need to visit us!" And the number is indicated there. From the moment people disappeared, we stopped trying to escape, to break something. This chasm is a nightmare of all. One ordinary dull day, someone came for me. <br/>
- Hey, convict! They came to you. Ha-ha, they will do everything to fell you comfortable, but only - this is worse than prison. - from the moment people disappear, guards beat people in this way. Sometimes they are taken so to battle, but as of now - into nothingness. My nightmare has come true. <br/>
   I was not allowed to take anything from my things, they just gave me the orange form with the inscription "D-91564". Whatever it meant, I didn’t like it. Since childhood, I was taught that getting a D with a number is bad. The uniform was with pockets, and comfortable. From the moment of imprisonment, I did not hold such clothes in my hands, but here it is necessary to wear it. Maybe it’s not so bad there? We'll see. I was led to exit the prison, there was no clear morality in the air. At the expense of clothing, prisoners have changed. Part of "D" was ready to arrange an escape or become a boss, others wanted to survive, others just flowed with the stream. I had a rule - any time trust intuition. That's how many times I didn’t act by intuition - so many times I made a mistake. Truly terrible? When intuition affects fate strongly. We were led to armored cars, they were like Hollywood films. Those who out from cars were with many guns. On the back was written "CB - Convoy Guard." Well, now I know the answer to the question "Why do they need so many weapons?" With this amount of weapons, the prison could be smashed to zero. The salon was ordinary. There were no bars on the glass. We drove for a very long time, once even crossed the border, in the end we arrived uphill. There was a huge outer part and the same or even larger inner part. We drove three checkpoints. In one checkpoint they had ten people, three of them with RPGs, three behind large-caliber guns, others were like walking tank. In general, the whole state in the state. When they arrived we were dressed in special bags, our hands were tied up and were was gagged with something in the mouth. They took out all this in the cameras from us. Obviously it was underground, because there was ventilation, there were no cameras, on the left side of the door there was a bed, on the head of the bedside table, and on the bedside table a note: "Welcome "D-91564, here we don’t give names or something like that, just numbers. There are no schedules. You can do anything in your cell, we don’t care. You can’t make anything like guns here, if it seems to us that you have weapons then we will search for everything. If we see a weapon in your hands, you will get a bullet in the head. For disobedience you gonna die, not a bullet in the head, it's something worse." Damn, the good rules are here. <br/>
   Well, I'm not going to sit here, I have to go through the complex. When I went to the door it opened. Opposite me was the same cell as another prisoner. Turning my head to the right, I'm saw a wall. When I walked away from the door, it closed. On the door was the inscription "D-91564 cell". When I was about to go see what is in this place, a guard came to me. <br/>
- This is your ID card. With it, you can open the camera, when it won’t be when Security Guards request it - they will stick a bullet in your head or send it to be eaten. - The guard gave this ID card and left. <br/>
   I put the pass in my pocket and then I saw where to put the card. It was a typical card reader. I am headed down the hall. When I went to the "intersection", what I saw was not pleasant to me. There's was the checkpoint. There was 20 people go on exoskeletons and with... Minigun?! What the hell? What are they hiding here? Although I do not want to know the answer! I decided to turn my head to the right. At the end of the corridor was a door with a combination lock, and next to the box. I decided to go left, it was relatively safe there. The corridor led to a mini shopping center. There was a rocking chair, an eating room, just benches, and several hucksters. The stomach said it’s time to eat. What time is it? Unknown. I will not see the sun again. Now why is everyone afraid of this jail. I decide to go to the dining room. Which food do they will cook for me? There's was deserted. Going to the supposed place of delivery of food, I saw the alleged cook. <br/>
- Uh... you cook? <br/>
- Yes. What did you want? And you are new! Let me explain the situation. You got here not for a long time. Nobody lives here for a long time. Old people here are like big brains. They know everything. I can provide work, you can take food and I will cook whatever you want for the money. With hucksters, It’s better not to quarrel. They will get anything. At least a shotgun, at least drugs. This floor is only for Class-D. All scientists may take you, without permission. They call Security Guards, they say how much they need and they pick you up. Your class means that you are guilty very hard. There are also classes: E, S, A. You can be transferred to Class-A for good behavior. Take it - said the cook and gave the food of the gods. Eating in a regular prison is complete crap. They were ordinary, cheap pasta with cheese, but that was enough for me. I decided to look at the rest of the room. Leaving the dining room, a view appeared: the four guards tied up three prisoners, tied their hands, put on a bag and took them away. From this I got goosebumps. After that, I saw a huge training apparatus before my eyes. Obviously not for simple prisoners. For whom it is destined I do not want to know. Suddenly a voice came: <br/>
- Everything back to their cells. Everyone back to their cells. Twenty minutes are given. - said a voice from nowhere. <br/>
Deciding that it is better not to argue and go to the camera. Returning to the camera, I saw a clock on the wall that showed at ten o’clock in the evening. Having decided that the best way to forget is to fall asleep. As an clever person said, if something creepy happens to you around, you need to sleep for at least two hours, than to suffer from these two hours, or it was something like that. The bed was very soft and comfortable so I fell asleep quickly.
