What are SCPStories? This is the site about SCP stories or other stories like about Class-D. We will be very grateful if you read at least part of our work, we tried very hard. 
There are, of course, few stories, but you can help us. I also added a recommendation tab so you can find interesting SCP's to read here. If you want or you liked everything you can <a href = "https://donate.qiwi.com/payin/SiteCreative"> donate </a>, the money will go to the development of the site. <a/> Have a good read. </div> </div>
